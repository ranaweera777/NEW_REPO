WHAT IS GIT_HUB 

GitHub is a platform that makes it easy for developers to collaborate on projects, track changes in code, and manage version control using Git. It's like a digital workspace where programmers can store, share, and improve code together. 

With GitHub, you can:
- Host and manage your code repositories.
- Work with others through collaboration tools.
- Track and roll back changes using version control.
- Share projects publicly or keep them private.
- Automate workflows with GitHub Actions.

Itâ€™s widely used by individuals, teams, and companies to streamline coding and software development. Have you worked with Git or GitHub before?
